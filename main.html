                Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!
                When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.
                Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.
                Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!
                 Don’t make a camel angry – they can spit as a way to distract whatever they think is a threat

                    Almost half of the world’s chameleon species live on the island of Madagascar
                    Their feet works like salad tongs.
                    Chameleons vary wildly in term of sizes.
                    They mainly change their colour in order to communicate or regulate body temperature.

                    There are around 3,000 cicada species, according to National Geographic, so they vary in size from 0.75 to 2.25 in (2.2 to 5.5 cm) long. Cicadas can be black, brown or green and can have red, white or blue eyes. Their wings are transparent and can seem rainbow-hued when held up to a light source.

    A giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear.
    Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.
    Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown).
